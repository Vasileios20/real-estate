# CB Real Estate

![Home Page](documentation/features/Home.png)

CB Real Estate represents the culmination of my efforts during the final project for Code Institute, serving as a dynamic platform designed for further development and potential client adoption. Focused on real estate, the site empowers users to effortlessly search for their next home, office space, or the ideal plot of land for construction. The inclusion of user accounts allows individuals to curate a personalized wishlist, tracking properties of interest, and facilitating seamless communication through a user-friendly contact form. Currently, property uploads are restricted to administrators, ensuring quality control, but the future vision includes the possibility for registered agents to contribute their listings. As the project evolves, CB Real Estate aims to provide an enriched and intuitive platform for users to explore and engage with the real estate market.
